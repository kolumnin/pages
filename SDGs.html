<P>Without enough restraints, my goals can not be positive, as my first steps on this oscreen fields are always random.
With the patterns generated, by actions give me a sense of joy, without entering into the thinking fields of the programers or the machine.
Thus all my "contributions" are just trying to utter a sound to express thanks for my experiences, looking into and touching this mobile screen!

<div>The Sustainable Development Goals 2030 ageed upon by the United Nations need be reexamined and innovated at every possible level with an additional division for realistic implementation. The humanity and the life on Earth is divided into 3 states of existence namely waking(jagrat), swapna(dream) and sleep(sushupti). The issues faced and possible solutions are different in the 3 states. Our perceptions of the global issues widely differ in the 3 states. The nature acts through all the 3 states without any partitions in time or space. The time-scales of sustainability of nature widely differ from our human needs, life-time and evaluations. Our ability to observe and evaluate the needs and fulfillments varies not only as individuals in the 3 different states but also collectively as one humanity trying to observe and know an individual in a different state. Collectively at any moment, one third of the living beings remain in one of the 3 states of waking, dream and sleep. A certain percentage of the beings are in a mixed state or fluctuating states depending on their mental activities. Currently, in our global networks, the 3 states are bound together by electric currents at various thresholds and over which we have no global control. Our individual capacity and ability to control this electric environment is highly limited too. The human conciousness need be awake inorder to participate in "action" pertaining to this control, while the network automation can still do action with no consciousness. Our development in AI remain artificial and can easily runaway in the human contexts. In short, to me a "global self-restraint" must necessarily be included in our list.
 I have <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/defenceunited/home/briefnotes">tried to classify</a> the currently accepted 17 goals further in terms of need in the different states as common(C), Rare(R) and Rarer(R). Please reexamine and suggest further steps for a better awareness and understanding.
